Hello,

I am Uvarov Michael. 
I am studding at Southern Federal University in Russia from 2008.
My github profile is here: https://github.com/freeakk
I want to implement a binding as an Erlang driver. I already have an 
experience with NIFs (Native Implemented Functions) 
(Code is here https://github.com/freeakk/i18n).

I implemented basic operations with Unicode both in pure Erlang and as NIF.
I think, that Erlang will be a good choice for binding, because it has a nice 
inter-node communication interface. This interface can be used as a transport 
for access to a remote database.

I have few questions and ideas about Xapian:

First of all, how does Xapian handle concurrent access to shared resources?
How many connections can be established to one database for reading and writing?
Who does coordinate parallel access to same database?
Are opening and closing a database expensive operations or not?
Is a minimal example of using Xapian with a real data set? 
Are there datasets for an efficiently testing?

I think it is a good idea for implementing this binding as a linked-in driver.
A driver provides a queue and Xapian classes are not thread-safe. So, it will 
be a mapping: one driver port -- one opening connection to a base.
NIFs will require an implementing of a thread pool in C, but it is not a trivial 
task.
Calls of NIFs can block a schedule of an virtual machine. It is also not good,
because other green processes will wait. 

I will wait for answers and your questions.


Thank you for the answers :)
The idea about Erlang is that it has few interfaces with C/C++:
- driver: 
    for slow operations, it is a program which waits requests throw stdio.
    It is a safest variant, for example, for image manipulating.
    If the C process crash, Erlang is still alive.
- linked-in driver:
    The same, but a driver is a dll. If it crashed, one Erlang node crashed 
    also. But it is faster.
    Use case: RDBMS drivers.
- NIF:
    If we run "module:fun(4)" from Erlang, we will call a C function with 
    TERM[1] array as argument. Is is simple, because we don't need encoding and 
    decoding data.
    It is faster because it use the same VM thread. Erlang uses the next 
    schema: one core of CPU - one thread for a schedule. When we call a NIF,
    it cannot be stopped. It will stop the world, the same behaviour in JVM 
    with GC.
    A NIF can provide resources. Resources are objects which can be automatically
    garbage collecting. Resources must be thread safe, because they can be shared
    between OS threads.
    Use case: ICU NIFs.



June: Creating an Erlang API.  Code a basic actions from classes Document, DB, 
    Enquire, TermGenerator as a functions.
July: Code basic examples (Indexer, Searcher) in Erlang. Extend the API 
    to allow usage of MultipleKeyMaker, 
August: Cleaning tests, writing documentation.

Biography (tell us a bit about yourself):

I am studding at Southern Federal University in Russia from 2008.


Eligibility: yes


Background Information
======================


__Have you taken part in GSoC and/or  GHOP and/or  GCI before?__

no


__Please tell us about any previous experience you have with Xapian, 
  or other systems for indexed text search.__

I used MyISAM full-text indexes. Also, I realized Unicode Collation Algorithm 
in Erlang.


__Do you have previous experience with Free Software and Open Source 
other than Xapian?__

I am a participant of erlang-question mail list.
I forked etorrent torrent client and wrote webui for it. 
I developed Erlang version of an Unicode collator and a library for handling 
  Unicode strings using Unicode Character Database.
I used many applications from Erlang/OTP:

mnesia, eunit, tv, appmon.

And applications from other developers:

* I created few small plugins for rebar. I am using lager and SASL for logging.
* I am using gproc as a dictionary of processes.
* I used mochiweb and cowboy as a web servers.
* I am an user of few JavaScript libraries: qooxdoo, ExtJS, jQuery and a former PHP enthusiast. 



__What other relevant prior experience do you have 
(courses taken at college, hobbies, holiday jobs, etc)?__

* Courses of C/C++.
* Coding in Erlang as a hobby.


__What development platforms, tools and methods do you prefer to use?__

Platform: Debian Linux, Erlang/OTP

Tools: rebar, make, git, vim

Methods: TDD


__Have you previously been responsible (as an employee/volunteer/student/etc) 
for a project of a similar scope? If so, tell us about it.__

I implimented ICU binding as NIFs. I used Erlang and C/C++. 
I learned a lot of things about interoperability of Erlang applications.


__What timezone will you be in during the coding period?__

GMT+4 / MSK


__Will your Summer of Code project be the main focus of your time during 
the program?__

yes

__How many hours a week will you realistically be able to 
devote to your project?__

20 hours

__Are you applying for other projects in GSoC 2012?__

no





Project name: Erlang binding
============================

Motivations
-----------

__Why have you chosen this particular project?__

* This project is one of the projects that uses Erlang/OTP. It is my passion.
* This project has strong background in an information retrieval field. 
* I am interested in developing back-end applications.
* I think, it is a good challenge for a developer to participate in this kind 
  of events.
* I realize, that this work will be useful for community.
* It is fun.


__Who will benefit from your project and in what ways?__

My project will serve both for the community of Erlang language and for 
Xapian. 


Project Details
===============

__Describe any existing work and concepts on which your project is based.__

This project will contain both Erlang and C++ code. The main ideas are to 
minimize code base of the driver from C++ part of the library and make 
calls thread-save.

My project will use an Erlang driver interface. Each driver port will handle 
queries syncronicly and have their own set of objects. It is because Xapian 
objects are not thread save.

Ports can be collected into a pool using an Erlang code and work in parallel.
I am planning to shape the project as an Erlang/OTP application.

I will use rebar for building and for dependency management, eunit for unit
testing and proper or triq for property testing.

I am planning to use the record syntax for retrieving information from a 
document and proplists or dict as a dictionary.

I also think, `qlc:table' interface can help to impliment iterators.

__What is new or different about your approach which hasn't 
been done or wasn't possible before?__

Other bindings use SWIG. My approach is to use only `erl_driver' interface.
It provides more wide opportunities to customize and tweak API for Erlang 
library. But it also requiries more work and knowledges.


__Do you have any preliminary findings or results which suggest 
that your approach is possible and likely to succeed?__

Yes, I have.

There are few interfaces in Erlang for C/C++ developers: 
cnode, driver, linked-in driver and NIFs.
I will use a linked-in driver to minimize latency. This interface can be 
replaced by a driver easily.

I will use a _gen\_server_ for encapsulation, because it is a time tested 
way to access to a shared object. 


__How useful will your results be when not everything works out exactly 
as planned?__

Bugs in Erlang code can be easy to find because of both supervising 
and logging. I will left C++ code as simple as possible to minimize bugs.
I will create tests for simple refactoring.
